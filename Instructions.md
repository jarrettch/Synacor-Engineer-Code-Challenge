# Synacor Engineer II Code Challenge

At Synacor, we typically build user experiences that take data from third-party services and safely display that data on the page.

## The Challenge

Build a simple JavaScript app/widget that does the following:

1. Makes a `GET` request to the provided IP geolocation API, which returns a JSON
response containing the latitude and longitude for the IP address from which the
request originated;
2. Makes a subsequent request to the given weather API, which returns the current
conditions for the latitude and longitude from the first step
3. Renders a User Interface that displays the temperature, a text description of the
current weather conditions, an icon representing those conditions, and the city.

## The API

We have deployed a CORS-enabled API for IP geolocation and weather lookup at
https://weathersync.herokuapp.com. There are two endpoints:

`/ip`
Get the geographic location of the requestor’s IP

`/weather/$lat,$lng`
Get weather for a given latitude & longitude

> Note: Icons
> The `icon` property returned from the weather endpoint can be used to request a
> PNG icon image using this URL:
> `http://openweathermap.org/img/w/${icon}.png`
> (example: http://openweathermap.org/img/w/03n.png)

## Acceptance criteria
* You may use any version of JavaScript/ECMAScript you like.
* Code must be written by you, with **no libraries or dependencies** other than those required for testing.
* Must run in modern browsers (Chrome & Firefox are fine). Don’t worry about supporting old browsers.
* The User Interface should fill the browser window.
* A wireframe is attached, describing what the layout should look like. Feel free to use whatever colors, fonts, and other design elements you like. _Note: other than the requirements stated above, you won’t be judged on design._
* **Unit test your JavaScript code**. You may use any Javascript test framework you like.
